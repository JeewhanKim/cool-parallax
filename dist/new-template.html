          <p>Wendy Simmons has built a 30-year career in management consulting, marketing and communications, helping companies of all sizes, across nearly every industry, identify and solve strategic business challenges and grow revenue.</p>
          <p>She founded Vendeloo in 2001 and has focused on developing and implementing comprehensive marketing and communications strategies, identifying and fostering strategic relationships, and advising senior management on overall business strategy.</p>
          <p>Since June 2017, she has concurrently served as Vice President of Corporate Marketing for Vendeloo client, Collinear Networks, helping brand the company and globally launch the company’s technology solution. </p>
          <p>From August 2006 through August 2016, she concurrently served as President and Chief Brand & Marketing Officer of MOSCOT, also a Vendeloo client, during which time she evolved the company from a small, local family retailer with two Manhattan-based stores selling third-party products, into a renown, multimillion dollar, international fashion brand. She created the company’s brand identity, messaging and creative, and led all domestic and international marketing and communications efforts across all channels. In addition, she developed the domestic and international wholesale distribution networks, growing it to include over 1200 specialty stores in more than 60 countries, in addition six mono-branded MOSCOT retail shops, including three international locations.</p>
          <p>Prior to forming Vendeloo, Wendy was Founder and President of Mindstorm Communications, a highly respected communications and marketing agency. Within two years, she grew Mindstorm to a team of 65 professionals and $7 million in annual revenue representing more than 75 clients, including Sony Electronics, Screaming Media, Cablevision, Silicon Graphics and Reebok, with offices in New York, San Francisco, Boston and Washington DC.
              When Golin/Harris International, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Interpublic Group of Companies, acquired Mindstorm, Wendy served as Executive Vice President of the agency’s New York City office, leading the consumer and technology business-to-business practices, and serving as strategic counselor to key clients before leaving the agency to form Vendeloo.</p>
          <p>Prior to starting Mindstorm, Wendy served as Senior Vice President at TSI Communications, one of the nation’s largest and most respected technology communications firms, where she led both the Sony and Business-to-Business account teams, representing close to 30% of TSI’s overall revenue. During her tenure at TSI, she tripled the Sony Electronics account to several million dollars per year and expanded the agency’s role to support all divisions of Sony Electronics including Sony Latin America. She also formed TSI’s Business-to-Business PR practice, and in less than three years, grew the practice to $2 million in revenue per year, working with nearly 40 companies in diverse areas of technology, both domestic and internationally.</p>
          <p>  Wendy is an intrepid and passionate world traveler who’s explored over 87 countries and counting. She chronicles her adventures on her blog http://wendysimmons.com.

She has also owned a bar in Manhattan, worked for a lobbying firm on Capitol Hill, written a Japanese-language phrase book, and taught reading and math to the “smart kids” at a private school. She has extensive public speaking experience, including national and local broadcast and radio appearances.
              Wendy graduated Summa Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa from George Washington University (with semesters spent in Spain and Japan) with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and a focus on Asian Studies and Japanese. Her Japanese is now terrible, but her Pig Latin is flourishing.
